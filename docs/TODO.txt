Brand New Player Steps:
Find Highsec system


 - Progression:
    Basic Income

    Early
    Construct small citadels for basic resources
    Construct small engineering complexes for larger sized ships
    Construct small drilling platforms for advanced resources

    Mid
    Conquer Systems using ICHs
    Construct medium citadels for more basic resources
    Construct medium engineering complexes for capital ships
    Construct medium drilling platforms for more advanced resources

    Late

 - Player Interaction
    Uses point system
        Prevent new players from being attacked by players with more than 3x their points
    Once a player achieves a new teir they cannot expand into the lower teir systems
    Players can destroy each other's structures
        medium drilling platforms can be destroyed, but new mediums need ICH
    ICH cannot be destroyed until the large citadel is destroyed

 - Universe
    High Security
        Small Citadels and Engineering Complexes can be constructed
            make much less money, protected against other players
    Low Security
        Medium Citadels and Engineering Complexes can be constructed
            make more money, but only have 3x point protection
        Small drilling platforms can be constructed
    Null Security
        All buildings can be constructed
            make most money
        No player protections

 - Solar System Layout
    Universe config sanity check
        Check there are NO name collisions at all (constellations, regions, systems, etc)
    non-directed graph
    1-7 connections per system
    find 1907 "names" for high and lowsec
        generate 5100 systems:
            end goal target numbers:
                1090 highsec
                 817 lowsec
                3193 nullsec
        start with 5100 nodes
        collect nodes into 340 constellations (15 nodes each)
        collect constellations into 68 regions (5 constellations each)
        sparsely connect nodes within constellations (1-3 per system, floodfill verified)
        sparsely connect constellations within regions (1-2 per constellation, floodfill verified)
        sparsely connect regions within the universe (4 per region, floodfill verified)
        use graph-tool to draw universe map

    security designation:
        Manual?

        Need to use NetworkX or graph-tool to find a "measure of center", then using a counting floodfill assign high, low, and null
        Then update region names based on overall security of region
        Then update constellation names based on region names (high, low, null)
        Then update system names based on constellation names (high, low)
        Keep null system names randomly generated

 - Pilot simulation?
    skill level, "effort", timezone, "morale", spies?, inventory?

 - Winning a universe round?
    should IdleISS be perpetual? or run Monthly rounds?
    Victory conditions?
        Most Systems
        Most Ships Killed
        Most Resources/Points Killed
        Most Resources/Points Efficient
        Most Resources Acquired
