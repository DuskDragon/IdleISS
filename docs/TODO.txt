 - Progression:
    Basic Income

    Early
    Construct small citadels for basic resources
    Construct small engineering complexes for larger sized ships
    Construct small drilling platforms for advanced resources

    Mid
    Conquer Systems using ICHs
    Construct medium citadels for more basic resources
    Construct medium engineering complexes for capital ships
    Construct medium drilling platforms for more advanced resources

    Late
    Construct large engineering complexes for supercapital ships
    Construct large citadels to hold control of ICH

 - Player Interaction
    Uses point system
        Prevent new players from being attacked by players with more than 3x their points
    Once a player achieves a new teir they cannot expand into the lower teir systems

        medium drilling platforms can be destroyed, but new mediums need ICH
    ICH cannot be destroyed until the large citadel is destroyed

 - Universe
    High Security
        Small Citadels and Engineering Complexes can be constructed
            make much more money, much more protected against other players
    Low Security
        Medium Citadels and Engineering Complexes can be constructed
            make more money, but only have 3x point protection
        Small drilling platforms can be constructed
    Null Security
        All buildings can be constructed
